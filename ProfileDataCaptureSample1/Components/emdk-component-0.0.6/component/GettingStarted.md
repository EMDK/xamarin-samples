## 3) Understand Profile Manager
One unique feature to EMDK for Xamarin is to control device behavior and configuration through the use of *profiles*. The EMDK Profile Manager lets you create profiles right from your IDE using a GUI interface for selecting the features and settings that your application wishes to use. Then in your application you would simply apply the profile when needed. This results in a simple approach and minimal lines of code required to accomplish tasks
