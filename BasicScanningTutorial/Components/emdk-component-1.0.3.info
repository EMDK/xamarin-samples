The EMDK for Xamarin includes class libraries, sample applications with source code, as well as all of the associated documentation to help your applications take full advantage of what Zebra Technologies devices have to offer.\n\nOne unique feature to EMDK for Xamarin is to control device behavior and configuration through the use of profiles. The EMDK Profile Manager lets you create profiles right from your IDE using a GUI interface for selecting the features and settings that your application wishes to use. Then in your application you would simply apply the profile when needed. This results in a simple approach and minimal lines of code required to accomplish tasks resulting in reduced development time, effort and errors.\n\nFeatures:\n\n* Supports Visual Studio 2013 and greater\n* Supports Xamarin Studio 4.10 and greater (Windows and Mac)\n* Installs as an IDE Plug-in for Visual Studio & Xamarin Studio\n* Online Documentation\n* Sample Code\n* Built-in Barcode API Sample\n* Online Data Capture Profile Sample\n* Online Wi-Fi Profile Sample\n* Symbol.XamarinEMDK APIs\n\t* EMDKManager, ProfileManager, VersionManager\n\t* Symbol.XamarinEMDK.Barcode\n\n## 1) Complete IDE Setup\nInstalling the Xamarin Component only enables the EMDK API library, you must complete the installation of the IDE integration.
